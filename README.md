# cleanUI
# Do.com is meant to be an event posting and reviewing website where people write about their own local events and get to know about new ones near them.

Clean and Simplistic User Interface designed on my understanding of the principles of User Experience improvement and design.

I have used Geolocation, UI Animations and rearranging panels to improve on the layout which common websites follow.

A simple website which follows basic UI principles to create a better experience.

To traverse the website, start off at Do_1614093.html. From there onwards, all elements are accessible and open a new page or lead back to another.
